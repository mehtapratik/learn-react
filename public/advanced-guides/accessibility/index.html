         <h1>Accessibility</h1>
         <p class="intro">
            React fully supports building accessible websites, often by using
            standard HTML techniques.
         </p>
         <p>
            Note that all aria-* HTML attributes are fully supported in JSX.
            Whereas most DOM properties and attributes in React are camelCased,
            these attributes should be hyphen-cased as they are in plain HTML.
         </p>
         <p>
            Sometimes we break HTML semantics when we add &lt; div &gt; elements
            to our JSX to make our React code work, especially when working with
            lists(&lt;ol&gt;, &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;dl&gt;) and the HTML
            &lt;table&gt;. In these cases we should rather use React Fragments
            to group together multiple elements.
         </p>
         <pre id="codeFragment"></pre>
         <p>
            When you don’t need any props on the Fragment tag you can use the
            short syntax, if your tooling supports it:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeShortFragment"></pre>
         <p>
            Although these standard HTML practices can be directly used in
            React, note that the for attribute is written as htmlFor in JSX:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeHtmlFor"></pre>
         <h2>Managing focus</h2>
         <p>
            Our React applications continuously modify the HTML DOM during
            runtime, sometimes leading to keyboard focus being lost or set to an
            unexpected element. In order to repair this, we need to
            programmatically nudge the keyboard focus in the right direction.
            For example, by resetting keyboard focus to a button that opened a
            modal window after that modal window is closed.
         </p>
         <p>To set focus in React, we can use Refs to DOM elements.</p>
         <pre id="codeRefFocus"></pre>
         <p>
            Sometimes a parent component needs to set focus to an element in a
            child component. We can do this by exposing DOM refs to parent
            components through a special prop on the child component that
            forwards the parent’s ref to the child’s DOM node.
         </p>
         <pre id="codeParentRef"></pre>
         <p>
            When using a HOC to extend components, it is recommended to forward
            the ref to the wrapped component using the forwardRef function of
            React. If a third party HOC does not implement ref forwarding, the
            above pattern can still be used as a fallback.
         </p>
