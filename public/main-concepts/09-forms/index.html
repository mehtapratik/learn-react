         <h1>Forms</h1>
         <p>
            In HTML, form elements such as &lt;input&gt;, &lt;textarea&gt;, and
            &lt;select&gt; typically maintain their own state and update it
            based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in
            the state property of components, and only updated with setState().
         </p>
         <p>
            We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single
            source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also
            controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An
            input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is
            called a “controlled component”.
         </p>
         <pre id="codeBasicInput"></pre>
         <p>
            Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed
            value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the
            source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to
            update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user
            types.
         </p>
         <p>
            With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by
            the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code,
            you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it
            from other event handlers.
         </p>
         <p>
            In HTML, a &lt;textarea&gt; element defines its text by its
            children. In React, a &lt;textarea&gt; uses a value attribute
            instead. This way, a form using a &lt;textarea&gt; can be written
            very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input.
         </p>
         <p>
            Similarly, React uses value attribute to handle dropdown selection
            as opposed to using selected attribute by HTML. You can also pass an
            array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple
            options in a select tag.
         </p>
         <p>
            Overall, this makes it so that &lt;input type="text"&gt;,
            &lt;textarea&gt;, and &lt;select&gt; all work very similarly - they
            all accept a value attribute that you can use to implement a
            controlled component.
         </p>
         <p>
            In React, &lt;input type="file"&gt; are handled bit differently
            because its value is read-only. The are known as &ldquo;uncontrolled
            component&rdquo; in React. It is discussed together with other
            uncontrolled components later in the documentation.
         </p>
         <h2>Handling multiple inputs</h2>
         <p>
            When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can
            add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function
            choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.
         </p>
         <pre id="codeMultiInputs"></pre>
         <p>
            Note how we used the ES6 computed property name syntax to update the
            state key corresponding to the given input name:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeCompProp"></pre>
         <h2>Uncontrolled components</h2>
         <p>
            It can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because
            you need to write an event handler for every way your data can
            change and pipe all of the input state through a React component.
            This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a
            preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application
            with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to
            check out &ldquo;uncontrolled components&rdquo;, an alternative
            technique for implementing input forms.
