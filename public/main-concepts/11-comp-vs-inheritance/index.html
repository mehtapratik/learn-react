         <h1>Composition vs. Inheritance</h1>
         <p class="intro">
            Makers of React recommends using composition approach instead of
            inheritance to make the out of it.
         </p>
         <p>
            In this section, we will consider a few problems where developers
            new to React often reach for inheritance, and show how we can solve
            them with composition.
         </p>
         <h2>Containment</h2>
         <p>
            Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. This is
            especially common for components like Sidebar or Dialog that
            represent generic “boxes”.
         </p>
         <p>
            We recommend that such components use the special children prop to
            pass children elements directly into their output. This lets other
            components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeChildrenProp"></pre>
         <p>
            While this is less common, sometimes you might need multiple “holes”
            in a component. In such cases you may come up with your own
            convention instead of using children:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeCustomHoles"></pre>
         <h2>Specialization</h2>
         <p>
            Sometimes we think about components as being “special cases” of
            other components. For example, we might say that a WelcomeDialog is
            a special case of Dialog.
         </p>
         <p>
            In React, this is also achieved by composition, where a more
            “specific” component renders a more “generic” one and configures it
            with props:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeSpecialization"></pre>
      </main>
