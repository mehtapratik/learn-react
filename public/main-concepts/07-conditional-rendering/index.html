         <h1>Conditional Rendering</h1>
         <p class="intro">
            Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in
            JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional
            operator to create elements representing the current state, and let
            React update the UI to match them.
         </p>
         <h2>Inline if with logical && operator</h2>
         <p>
            You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces.
            This includes the JavaScript logical && operator. It can be handy
            for conditionally including an element:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeInlineIf"></pre>
         <p>
            It works because in JavaScript, true && expression always evaluates
            to expression, and false && expression always evaluates to false.
         </p>
         <p>
            Therefore, if the condition is true, the element right after && will
            appear in the output. If it is false, React will ignore and skip it.
         </p>
         <p>
            Just like in JavaScript, it is up to you to choose an appropriate
            style based on what you and your team consider more readable. Also
            remember that whenever conditions become too complex, it might be a
            good time to extract a component.
         </p>
         <h2>Preventing component from rendering</h2>
         <p>
            In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though
            it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead
            of its render output.
         </p>
         <p>
            Returning null from a component’s render method does not affect the
            firing of the component’s lifecycle methods.
         </p>
