         <h1>Lists and Keys</h1>
         <p>
            In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is as simple as
            using a map function.
         </p>
         <pre id="codeSimpleMap"></pre>
         <section id="previewSimpleMap" class="preview"></section>

         <p>
            A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when
            creating lists of elements. Keys help React identify which items
            have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the
            elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeKeyMap"></pre>
         <p>
            The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely
            identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use
            IDs from your data as keys. When you don’t have stable IDs for
            rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last
            resort. We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of
            items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may
            cause issues with component state. If you choose not to assign an
            explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes
            as keys.
         </p>
         <p>
            Keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array. For
            example, if you extract a ListItem component, you should keep the
            key on the &lt;ListItem /&gt; elements in the array rather than on
            the &lt;li&gt; element in the ListItem itself.
         </p>
         <pre id="codeSurroundingArray"></pre>
         <p>
            Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings.
            However they don’t need to be globally unique. We can use the same
            keys when we produce two different arrays.
         </p>
         <p>
            Keys serve as a hint to React but they don’t get passed to your
            components. If you need the same value in your component, pass it
            explicitly as a prop with a different name.
