         <h1>Introducing JSX</h1>
         <p class="intro">
            The HTML/XML like tag syntax used by React is JSX. It is syntax
            extension to JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”.
         </p>
         <p>
            React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled
            with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes
            over time, and how the data is prepared for display. Instead of
            artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in
            separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units
            called “components” that contain both.
         </p>
         <p>
            React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as
            a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It
            also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
         </p>
         <p>
            JSX prevents inection attacks. It is safe to embed user input in
            JSX. By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before
            rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything
            that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is
            converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS
            (cross-site-scripting) attacks.
         </p>
         <p>
            JSX represents objects. Babel compiles JSX down to
            React.createElement() calls. Furthermore, React.createElement()
            performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but
            essentially it creates an object literal that holds the description
            of what you want to render on screen. These object literals are
            called “React elements”. React reads these objects and uses them to
            construct the DOM and keep it up to date.
         </p>
         <pre id="codeJsx"></pre>
         <p>Above is same as below:</p>
         <pre id="codeCreateEl"></pre>
         <p>Both, essentially creates an object like this:</p>
         <pre id="codeReactEl"></pre>
         <h2>Scratchpad</h2>
         <h3>Hello {name}</h3>
         <p>
            You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces
            in JSX:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeHelloName">Code example</pre>
         <section class="preview" id="hello"></section>

         <h3>Hello {userObject}</h3>
         <p>
            After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript
            function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects. This means that
            you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to
            variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeUserObject">Code example</pre>
         <div class="preview">
            <section id="userObject"></section>
            <section id="invalidObject"></section>
         </div>

         <h3>Attributes with string and expression values</h3>
         <p>
            You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes. You may
            also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an
            attribute. Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a
            JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes
            (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both
            in the same attribute:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeExAttributes">Code example</pre>
         <section class="preview" id="elWithAttr"></section>
         <p>
            Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses
            camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute
            names. For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex
            becomes tabIndex.
         </p>

         You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.
