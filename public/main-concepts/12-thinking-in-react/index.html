         <h1>Thinking in React</h1>
         <p class="intro">
            One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about
            apps as you build them.
         </p>
         <h2>Identify components and their hierarchy</h2>
         <p>
            The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every
            component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.
         </p>
         <p>
            ut how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same
            techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or
            object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle,
            that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up
            growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
         </p>
         <p>
            Once components are identified, you should establish their
            hierarchy.
         </p>
         <h2>Build static version</h2>
         <p>
            Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement
            your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data
            model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to
            decouple these processes because building a static version requires
            a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a
            lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.
         </p>
         <p>
            To build a static version of your app that renders your data model,
            you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass
            data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to
            child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state
            at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for
            interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a
            static version of the app, you don’t need it.
         </p>
         <p>
            At the end of this step, you’ll have a library of reusable
            components that render your data model. The components will only
            have render() methods since this is a static version of your app.
         </p>
         <h2>Identify minimal representation of UI state</h2>
         <p>
            To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes
            to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.
         </p>
         <p>
            The key here is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Figure out the absolute
            minimal representation of the state your application needs and
            compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re
            building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t
            keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want
            to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.
         </p>
         <h2>Identify where your state should live</h2>
         <p>
            Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this
            state.
         </p>
         <p>
            React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy.
            It may not be immediately clear which component should own what
            state. This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to
            understand, so follow these steps to figure it out:
         </p>
         <p>For each piece of state in your application:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Identify every component that renders something based on that
               state.
            </li>
            <li>
               Find a common owner component (a single component above all the
               components that need the state in the hierarchy).
            </li>
            <li>
               Either the common owner or another component higher up in the
               hierarchy should own the state.
            </li>
            <li>
               If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the
               state, create a new component solely for holding the state and
               add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner
               component.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Add inverse data flow</h2>
         <p>
            So far, we’ve built an app that renders correctly as a function of
            props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it’s time to support
            data flowing the other way: any user interaction in child component
            needs to trigger state change in common ancenstor managing the
            state. This is achieved by passing callbacks from parent component
            to child. This callback function will be executed by child component
            upon user interactions. And the callback function will update the
            state as needed.
