         <h1>Components and Properties</h1>
         <p class="intro">
            Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept
            arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements
            describing what should appear on the screen.
         </p>
         <p>
            You can either declare a React component inside a JavaScript
            functions or by using an ES6 class. React components declared as
            functions are known as “function components”.
         </p>
         <h2>Function and Class Components</h2>
         <p>
            The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript
            function:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeFuncComp">code example</pre>
         <section id="previewFuncComp" class="preview"></section>
         <pre id="codeEs6Class">code example</pre>
         <section id="previewEs6Class" class="preview"></section>

         <h2>Rendering a Component</h2>
         <p>
            You can either declare your React elemment that represents
            intrinstic DOM elements or you can define your own element. In later
            case, React passes JSX attributes and its children to the declared
            components as a single object - props.
         </p>
         <p>
            Always start component names with a capital letter. React treats
            components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags.
         </p>
         <h2>Composing Components</h2>
         <p>
            Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets
            us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail.
            Typically, new React apps have a single App component at the very
            top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might
            start bottom-up with a small component like Button and gradually
            work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.
         </p>
         <h2>Props are read-only</h2>
         <p>
            Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must
            never modify its own props.
         </p>
         <p>
            Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. React
            offers “state” for this purpose. State allows React components to
            change their output over time in response to user actions, network
            responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.
         </p>
         <pre id="codeButton"></pre>
         <section id="previewButton" class="preview"></section>

         You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.
