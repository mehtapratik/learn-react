         <h1>Rendering Elements</h1>
         <p class="intro">
            Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps. An element
            describes what you want to see on the screen:
         </p>
         <pre id="codeElement">Code Exmaple</pre>
         <p>
            Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and
            are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to
            match the React elements.
         </p>
         <p>
            Elements are not components. Elements are what components are “made
            of”.
         </p>
         <p>
            Usually applications created with React have a single "root" DOM
            node. Everything inside is managed by React DOM. To render anything
            inside this root DOM node, use ReactDOM.render() method.
         </p>
         <p>
            React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t
            change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame
            in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.
         </p>
         <p>
            React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one,
            and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the
            desired state.
         </p>
         <p>Consider this ticking clock example:</p>
         <pre id="codeTicks">Code example:</pre>
         <section class="preview" id="previewTicks"></section>
         <p>
            Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on
            every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets
            updated by React DOM. You can verify by inspecting the last example
            with the browser tools.
         </p>
         <p>
            In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any
            given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a
            whole class of bugs.
