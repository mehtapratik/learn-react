         <h1>Lifting State Up</h1>
         <p>
            Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We
            recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common
            ancestor.
         </p>
         <pre id="codeCalculator"></pre>
         <section id="previewCalculator" class="preview"></section>
         <p>
            There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes
            in a React application. Usually, the state is first added to the
            component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components
            also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor.
            Instead of trying to sync the state between different components,
            you should rely on the top-down data flow.
         </p>
         <p>
            Lifting state involves writing more “boilerplate” code than two-way
            binding approaches, but as a benefit, it takes less work to find and
            isolate bugs. Since any state “lives” in some component and that
            component alone can change it, the surface area for bugs is greatly
            reduced.
         </p>
         <p>
            If something can be derived from either props or state, it probably
            shouldn’t be in the state.
